GitHub account was created for the purpose of my Web Developement course in WakeTech Community College.
The repository was created for the purpose of submitting the assignments I am left in my Web Developer course.
First thing I did was download GitHub on google chrome, then I opened the repository I created on GitHub web. After this I clicked on the drop down menu and created a clone, which I saved to my CTI.110 Folder on my desktop. Finally, I edited this README.md text file with this information.
